# Rust Borrow Checker Error: Mutable and Immutable Borrows

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Rust when dealing with mutable and immutable references: attempting to borrow a value immutably while it's already borrowed mutably.  The Rust compiler's borrow checker prevents this to ensure data integrity and prevent data races.

## The Problem

The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to borrow a variable mutably and immutably at the same time.  This leads to a compiler error because the mutable borrow prevents any other borrows, even immutable ones.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.rs` file shows a corrected version of the code. It demonstrates different ways of resolving the error, depending on the desired outcome. Often, refactoring is needed to achieve a solution.
